## How it works | |

This project uses an LSFR register to randomize different number sets that represent the standard dice used in Tabletop RPG Systems; d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20, d100. I then use an adder to add a modifier to that end result. It then has a seven segment display module that converts the output into a number.

## External Hardware | |

This will need a 4 digit seven segment display.
