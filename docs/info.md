## How it works |

This project uses an LSFR register to randomize different number sets that represent the standard dice used in Tabletop RPG Systems; d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20. I then use an adder to add a modifier to that end result. It then has a seven segment display module that converts the output into a number.

## How to test |
Fill out later, not sure how it functions, exactly!

## External Hardware |

This will need a 4 digit seven segment display.
